// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, 
	// presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: 
// "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd 
// choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix 
// for the number based on what it is.

var Ceos = ["Larry Ellison", "Steve Jobs", "Warren Buffet", "Mark Zuckerberg", "Michael Bloomberg"]

var secondCEO = Ceos[1]

var thirdCEO = Ceos[2]

console.log("My first choice is "+ firstCEO + ". My second choice is " + secondCEO + ". My third choice is " + thirdCEO + ".");
